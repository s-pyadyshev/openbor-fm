"OpenBor stats"

"Quick description"
A useful application to help edit and manage openBor projects.

"DonateWare".
If you like this app please consider donating. Goto < http://sites.google.com/site/totaltextcontainer/donate > Thank You.

"Entity Overlay"
The main function of it is one word......."Alignment" I have been using it like crazy these last few weeks in making sure that all animations are aligned properly. So you select attack and then you overlay the same characters idle image over it and check if the feet position are aligned and then you move the offset of all frames there after appropriately.

Then you can use it also with "throw" moves and also attack moves that uses special effects (like echo's, blade glow etc) and see if each character frame is aligned with the effects frame.

"Empty Extensions"
If you are working with images that contain no extensions then you can set what format openBor Stats will decode  them as.
In the config, To use gif (default)
[Config]
BlankFiles=gif
To use PNG
[Config]
BlankFiles=png

"Text Pad"
A powerful and functional editor has been added to help simplify editing using the traditional notepad route but with plenty of usefull features.
You can double click or press ctrl+return on any line and it will give you a detailed description on what that command does and how to use it.
Hint. Don't forget to use F9/F10 during the editor.

"Glossary System"
No need to know any commands used by openBor or where each command should go anymore.
The Glossary system shows you all possible commands that can be used no matter what part of the entity your editing.
Missing Glossary commands, no problem. Just add or modify one as you see fit in the System Editor giving you the ability to change features as openBor changes.

"Character Editor"
Easily modify characters with the openBor Stats character editor.
Can also easily edit the scipt with the in build editor and or use edit box's to modify information.

"Test Factory"
Easily test a entity in a Tiny prebuild basic package.
This can help you test if the character is working properly and if the character is preforming the way you want it to, giving a quick way of tweaking him.
"How to use test factory"
.Open a project
.Expand Models>>Enemies
.Hold in control
.Select two or three enemies.
.Expand Models>>Player
.Select a player.
.Then right click any selected entity and click on "Test Factory" and click on the "Test" button.
NB! Do not select weapons, knifes, stars etc... as they will crash openBor.
You can goto the Tools menu and it will call up the previous used entities in the Test Factory.
You can set default paramaters such as knifes, stages etc within "openBorStats\Tools\Test" as that is the default settings that get used.

"Format Factory"
Format factory allows you to easily and correctly format a Entity text file. This will replace spaces where there should be a tab etc...
Detects script areas and won't cause any changes there.

"Colors"
'Anim list' (Left area)
Navy = Contains script
'Frame details' (right area)
Maroon = No exiting value
Blue = Has a value even if its null

"Shortcut Keys"
CTRL+Left Arrow/Right Arrow = Copies frame settings of the characters frame details. If you have your cursor on a attack box (lets say x) then you press Crtl+Left arrow then it will copy the previous frames details. Same for bbox,offset and move settings.
F3 = Call up the Main Screen.
F4 = Test Factory
F5 = Level Editor
F6 = Character Editor
F7 = Set to Frame Mode / Set to Project Mode
F8 = Set to Editor Mode
F9 = Previous Anim / Previous Project item
F10 = Next Anim / Next Project item
F11 = Previous Frame
F12 = Next Frame

"Shortcut Keys in Character Editor"
CTRL = add/set Body box mode . (Press Ctrl While the mouse is over the entity image area.)
SHIFT = add/set Attack box mode . (Press Shift While the mouse is over the entity image area.)

"Scripting"
BorScript  = The standard text of entity, model and level files(The stuff that everyone knows).
CodeScript = C script used in openBor(The hard stuff).

"Limitations"
All files and directories must be located without "spaces" in them. It doesn't matter how long the file/directories names are but openBor Stats doesn't support spacing in file/directory names anywhere. This "C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop\OpenBOR\SGMB" won't work but this will "C:\SGMB\Data".
The character editor is more of a character modifier than a character creator, more features need to be added.
The front page grid is just a information list to help easily navigate with Entity and Level files.
openBor Stats does not support decimal/float values and just sets them to 0 as openBor does not fully support them. I will only fix this if openBor actually starts using decimal values as I realised to late while devoloping that openBor does that and its just way to much work to change the openBor Stats engine without a real need for it.

"Source Code Compile"
You will need delphi 7 + the Jedi 3 component pack.

"3rdParty Apps"
All 3rd Party app are copy right by there developers and can be located in the Tools Directory.
