<b><font size="+1" class="big">1. Putting the graphics and music in a level  </font> </b><br><br>
Define the following properties at the beginning of the level file. <br><br>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600" height="50">

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> music		data/music/saviour.bor</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> Give the command music and the location of the music. This music will be played, and looped during the level. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> bossmusic	data/music/1boss.bor</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">The bossmusic will start to play when a boss is spawned. If you don't use bossmusic the regular level music will keep playing. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> hole [scrollpos]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">A hole will be made at the defined scrollposition at the bottom of the level. (More about the scrollpos at the end of chapter 2). <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> endhole		1</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">The level will end with a hole from top to bottom when all the level is out of panels, as defined in the "order". Useful for elevators. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>background [path]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	Specify the location of the background image to use in the level.
	This should be a 256-colour image. The first 128 colours in the palette (index 0-127)
	should be equal to those of the global palette (more info on this subject can be
	found on the <a href="characters.html">character page</a>). The other colours
	(index 128-255) may be used at your discretion (except if you use neon panels, see below).
	<br><br>
	The width of the background image should be a <i>multiple of four</i> for the image to
	align properly! So, 200 is a valid width, but 201 is not.
	<br><br>
	The background image's height may be anything between 1 and 240.
	<br><br>
	Example:<br>
	background data/bgs/bridge/harbor.gif
	<br><br>
	<b>Mandatory</b>

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>water	data/bgs/boat2/water.gif	15</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	Define an image to use as water. This image will be placed directly under
	the background image (see above). If "rock" is enabled (see below), the
	water surface will be drawn as a plane (as in level 3). If not, it will
	be warped with a sine (as in level 4). You may also define the strength
	of the sine deformation. 15 is a good value.
	<b> Optional</b>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>rock	1</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> The entire level will move slightly up and down, just like a boat :) <b> Optional</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>panel [path] [path] [path]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	Specify the images to use as "panels". These are the sections
	that make up a level.<br>
	<br>
	A panel is normally 244 pixels high, and can have just about any width.
	It is advised, however, to use a width of 100 or 200 pixels. This way
	you can easily determine the width of your entire level by counting the
	panels.<br>
	<br>
	If you're making a boat level, panels should be 256 pixels high because
	the level will move up and down a bit.
	<br>
	All panels in the same level should have the same dimensions.
	<br>
	Panels are drawn as sprites, i.e. the first colour in your palette
	(index 0) will be transparent.<br>
	<br>
	You may specify three paths:<br>
	The first one defines the image to be displayed in <i>normal</i> mode.<br>
	The second one defines the image to be displayed in <i>neon</i> mode.<br>
	The third one defines the image to be displayed in <i>screen</i> mode.<br>
	It is advised to prevent overlapping of the three images, as it is a
	waste of CPU time.<br>
	<br>
	Images displayed in <i>neon</i> mode will be remapped as follows:
	colour index 128 through 135 will be cycled two steps, three times
	per second. You can use this to create blinking lights.
	To use the <i>neon</i> effect properly, you'll need to have some
	understanding of working with palettes and palette rotation.
	<br><br>
	Images displayed in <i>screen</i> mode will appear translucent.
	It is implemented in the same way as Photoshop's screen mode:
	Black is fully transparent, and white is fully opaque.
	You may use this to create stuff like windows or coronas.
	<br><br>
	If you do not want to use a specific kind of panel, enter "none"
	as the path (without the quotation marks).
	<br><br>
	The maximum number of panels per level is 26.
	<br><br>
	Example: panel data/bgs/bridge/bridge10.gif none none
	<br><br>
	<b>Mandatory</b>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>order	abcd</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	The order in which the panels appear in the level. This also defines the width of the level.
	The maximum length of the order is 1000. However, you cannot specify that many characters on
	a single line (about 100 max). So if you want to make a very big level, distribute the order
	over multiple lines, like so:<br>
	<br>
	order	abcd<br>
	order	efgh<br>
	order	abcd<br>
	order	ijkl<br>
	<br>
	<b>Mandatory</b>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> frontpanel	data/bgs/street/f00.gif</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	Like the aforementioned panels, only much simpler. You cannot specify any
	front panels to be displayed with any effects.
	Front panels will be displayed in front of all other sprites (except the
	status window). The maximum number of front panels is 26.
	<br><br>
	<b>Optional</b>
</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>direction [direction]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	You may specify a direction for levels to scroll in.
	Valid directions are <i>up, down, left</i> and <i>right.</i>
	Up and down are used for elevators, obviously.
	By default, levels scroll to the right.
	<br><br>
	<b>Optional</b>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>mirror [0/1]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">
	When mirror mode is enabled, the program will draw copies of all objects between
	the panels and the background. You may use this to create mirrors on the walls
	(as seen in level 6).
	<br><br>
	<b>Optional</b>
</td>

<b><font size="+1" class="big">2. Putting the enemies in.  </font> </b><br><br>


After creating the backgrounds for your level, you can start putting in the enemies, objects, and items. There are a number of things you can do in a level. We'll first start with adding enemies, objects, and items. When a property for a "character" is used, remember that this also applies for objects and items. <br><br>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600" height="50">

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> spawn	[id]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">Command to spawn a character, object or item in a level. The id is the characters name a defined in the <i>character.txt</i>. <b>Mandatory</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> alias	[name]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">Change the displayed name. If you don't use this the name defined in the <i>character.txt</i> will be used. Names consisting of more parts must be connected with an underscore (e.g. Timmy_Turner) <b> Optional</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> map	[num] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> This changes the colourmap for this character, as defined in the <i>character.txt</i>. E.g. Ralf has 3 remap colours. If you don't define the map, it will take the standard colour. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> health	[num]</td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> This changes the health of the character. When it is not used, the standard health for this character will be used. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>item	[id] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> Only obstacles can contain items, and only one item. However items can also be spawned without an obstable. Simply state "spawn 1up" (for instance). 
 <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200>2pitem [id]  </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> You can also have items that will only be spawned when 2 players play simultaniously. use 2pitem for this. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> boss	[0/1] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> Use 1 for a boss, and 0 for a regular enemy (or leave it out). You can have multiple bosses, but once a boss has been defeated the level ends. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> flip	[0/1] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle">0 = face left, 1 = face right. With this you can flip a character horizontaly, only useful for objects. <b>Optional</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> coords	[num] [num] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> These are the coordinates at wich the character will spawn relative to scroll posistion. The first number is the x coordinate, the second number is the y coordinate of the screen. So to spawn a character in the top left of the screen you need coords 0 160. Between x coordinates 0 and 320 an enemy will fall out of the air (objects and items suddenly appear). To have a character walk into the screen you must use a x coordinate of about 350 (to let him walk in from the right) of -30 (to let him walk in from the left). Use a larger x coordinate for biker-k's (e.g. 400), because of their speed. <b>Mandatory</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

<img src="images/coords.gif" width="320" height="240"><br>The coordinates in BOR.<br><br><br>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600" height="50">

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> at	[scrollpos] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> Use this to give the position in the level when the character should be spawned. The number can range from 0 to the end of the level. E.g when the scrollpos is 700 the character will be spawned after the hero walked through a little over 2 screens. <b>Mandatory</b></td>

spawn	ralf <br>
alias	Timmy_Turner <br>
map	1 <br>
health	45 <br>
coords	-30 210 <br>
at	700 <br>
</i><br><br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>



<b><font size="+1" class="big">3. Other commands </font> </b><br><br>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600" height="50">

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> wait <br>
	at	[scrollpos] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> This blocks scrolling until all enemies, that were spawned prior to the wait, are defeated. <b></b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200> group	[min] [max] <br>
	at	[scrollpos] </td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"> 
 If the number of enemies drops below [min], more enemies will be spawned
 (if possible).

 No more than [max] enemies will be present.

 So, to make enemies appear in groups of four, use this:
 group 1 4.

 To make them appear normally, use this:
 group 100 100.
<br>
Waits, objects and items do not count in a group AFTER they have been spawned. Before spawning, they do count. So if you work with a small group (e.g. group 1 2), a wait will only be spawned when only one enemy is left. Therefore it is best to us groups only when a wait is already active.

<b></b></td>
</tr>
</table>


<br><br>
<b> Example of a <u>bad</u> grouping</b> <br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="150" height="50">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200><i>

group	2 2 <br>
at	700 <br>
<br>
spawn	ralf <br>
coords	-30 210 <br>
at	700 <br>
<br>
spawn	ralf <br>
coords	380 210 <br>
at	700 <br>
<br>
spawn	ralf <br>
coords	380 210 <br>
at	700 <br>
<br>

wait <br>
at	700<br>

</i>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

</table>


There will always be 2 enemies present, until all are defeated. So if you don't defeat 2 enemies, the wait will not become active, and the player can keep walking.
<br><br>
So you should do it like this:

<br><br>
<b> Example of a <u>good</u> grouping</b> <br>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="150" height="50">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="middle" width=200><i>
wait <br>

</i>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>




<b><font size="+1" class="big">4. Levels.txt </font> </b><br><br>

In  data\levels.txt the order of the levels are defined. And here's how you do it.<br><br>
