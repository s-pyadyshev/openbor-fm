<b><font size="+2" class="big">Creating BOR music files</b></font><br><br>

The Beats of Rage edit pack contains a program to convert WAV files to BOR files.
BOR files are the standard by which Beats of Rage plays its music. In this
standard, a simple ADPCM algorithm is used to compress/decompress the audio.

<br><br>
<br><br>

To create your own music files for use in you mod, you must first create a
WAV file containing a loop. Save this file with the following properties:
<br>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Format:</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">PCM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Bit-depth:</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">16-bit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Channels:</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">mono</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Sample frequency:</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">22050 (22 KHz) *</td>
</tr>
</table>
* Actually, the program can play music at any frequency, but this
frequency provides the best quality/size ratio.

<br><br>
<br><br>

The easiest way to convert your WAV file is probably by creating a
batch file (*.BAT). To do so, simply create a text file and rename
it to convert.bat (or grampa.bat or eatme.bat or whatever).
<br><br>

Enter a command into the batch file according to the following syntax:<br>
<b>wav2bor.exe [wav-file] [bor-file]</b>
<br><br>

Example:<br>
wav2bor.exe mymusic.wav mymusic.bor
<br><br>

Now execute the batch, and your file will be converted in mere seconds.

To learn how to enter the music files into the game, read about
<a href="levels.html">levels</a> and <a href="scenes.html">scenes</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> some music files are required. See the list of <a href="required.html">required files</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Note 2:</b> You may also enter an artist and title to be saved with the
BOR file:<br>
wav2bor.exe [wav-file] [bor-file] [artist] [title]<br>
Replace spaces by underbars (_). At this time, this information is not
displayed in the game, but this feature may be added in future releases.
