The actual mod data is in the "Data" folder.

<br><br>
To make a packfile, double-click on makepack.bat to make a PAK file out of your 
Data folder. You can find the newly created packfile in the Paks directory.

<br><br>

You may run your mod from the Data folder by clicking on the OpenBOR executable. 
If you want to play a packed mod with the included 
engine, you'll need to temporarily rename your Data folder to something else.

<br><br>

The OpenBOR program does not distinguish between slashes and backslashes,
so in all text files you may use either one (data\sounds\pop.wav is the same as data/sounds/pop.wav).

<br><br>

This manual covers the features found in the original Beats of Rage engine, but 
it still applies to OpenBOR and it's a good guide to getting started. For a 
manual describing most of the features in the OpenBOR engine, try

manual</a>.
