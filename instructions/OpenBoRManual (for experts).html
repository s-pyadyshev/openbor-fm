<div class="vspace"></div><h2>General Info</h2>
<p><a name="GeneralInfo" id="GeneralInfo"></a>
<strong>Beats of Rage</strong>
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><div class="indent">Beats of Rage is a semi
3D beat 'em up game made by Senile Team. It is inspired by Streets of
Rage series, popular and great semi 3D beat 'em up games by SEGA for
Genesis console. However this game uses King of Fighters (a 2D 1vs1
game) sprites as its sprites for heroes and enemies.
</div><div class="indent">As a beat 'em up game, this game has
features like combo which performed by tapping attack button after it
hits enemy, jump and jumpattacks, <span class="wikiword">SoR2</span> (Streets of Rage 2) style special, Capcom style grabattacks and <span class="wikiword">SoR2</span>
style throw. There are various enemies in this game, some of them can
perform upper attack to hit jumping heroes, some of them can break free
from grabs, some of them can grab or throw heroes etc. <span class="wikiword">SoR2</span> style bikers can also be found here. Of course items like foods and 1Up are also available here.
</div><div class="indent">This great game is also moddable which allows
players or modders to modify a mod or even make mods. The method of
modding is quite simple cause it's basicly about providing pictures,
sprites, wavs and animated gifs and converting them for use in <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>
and also setting them with powerful text files (so to speak) for making
heroes, enemies, levels etc. In fact, Beats of Rage is actually
comprised of Pak and engine (<span class="wikiword">BoR</span>.exe). We
could say that Pak is the body while engine is the soul. That's also
the reason why mods are usually only in the form of Pak without the
engine.
</div><div class="indent">Pak isn't editable (in normal way) that's
why before modding, modders need to unpak a mod 1st. After modding is
finished, the mod can be packed to be played. Actually it's possible to
play a mod without packing but it's best to pak it to make it neat.
This great game attracted many players which formed <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> community.
</div><div class="indent">Even though modding is that simple, <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>
have many features which have their own usage and their own place (or
text to be exact) to declare. This manual is for explaining those
features and where they can be declared.
</div><div class="indent">Due to lack of required features from <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> (Beats of Rage) and many requests, some coders stepped in to improve <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>, coded those missing features and fulfilled some requests. There were some <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> variations because of that e.g <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>, <span class="wikiword">DarkBoR</span> and  HOR. <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> is the most advanced one and this manual includes <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> features. Actually latest <span class="wikiword">OpenBor</span> support scripts but it's not included here.
</div><div class="vspace"></div><hr>
<div class="vspace"></div><h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p><a name="GettingStarted" id="GettingStarted"></a>
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><div class="indent">Before you can start
modding, you need the ingredients. Most of ingredients are sprites and
texts. Due to many required files and complexity of them, it's highly
recommended to start modding by editing available mod or pak instead of
creating the ingredients one by one. Another way is by DL-ing <span class="wikiword">BoREdit</span> pack from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.senileteam.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.senileteam.com/</a> and expand it. The pack contains enough basic ingredients to start a mod.
</div><p class="vspace"><strong>Extracting an existing PAK File:</strong>
</p><div class="indent">~You'll need a program called PAXPLODE.exe. which can be DL-ed from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lavalit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavalit.com/</a>. You need to register there 1st before you can DL anything though.
</div><div class="indent">~Put this program in same folder with .pak that you want to 'explode'.
</div><div class="indent">~Run this command: paxplode.exe [pakname] to 'explode' the pak. [pakname] is the name of .pak file (.pak is included).
</div><div class="indent">~If you do it right, a window showing DOS messages about extracting files will appear.
</div><div class="indent">~The extracted files should be in same folder in new folder named DATA.
</div><div class="indent">~NOTE: Some ppl reported that the files
aren't in same folder with Windows XP. If that happens, find folder
named DATA in your harddisk. I don't understand why this could happen.
It work like I said above in Windows 98SE.
<div class="vspace"></div></div><div class="indent">Inside DATA
folder, there should be various folders whose name are: BGS, CHARS,
LEVELS, MUSIC, SCENES, SOUNDS and SPRITES. Aside from those, there
should be text files i.e models.txt, levels.txt, lifebar.txt and
video.txt and pal.act. Each text files have their own explanation which
will be explained in their own section below.
</div><div class="indent">Pal.act is global palette. For your
information, every sprite in mod must use same palette which is this
global palette. You need Adobe Photoshop to view and make .act files.
</div><div class="indent">About the folders, each contains files and
texts related to folder name. So BGS contains background pictures and
palettes, CHARS contains character's sprites and texts etc.
</div><div class="indent">NOTE: Some folders aren't mandatory meaning
you can put all of their files in same folder (still within DATA folder
that is) and it would still work (provided the paths are correct).
However it's recommended to use different folders like above to make
modding easier. You can add another folders if you need to, just make
sure the paths are correct.
<div class="vspace"></div></div><div class="indent">By the way, you can play this paxploded mod!. Yes you can!
</div><p class="vspace"><strong>Playing paxploded PAK:</strong>
</p><div class="indent">~Put bor.exe in same folder as DATA folder (if you are still using old <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> engine).
</div><div class="indent">~If you are using <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>, put <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>.exe,
every .dll and other folders like LOGS, MENU, PAKS, SAVES and
SCREENSHOTS which come with it in same folder as DATA folder. Don't
forget to put empty .pak in PAKS folder. You can get empty .pak from <span class="wikiword">BoREdit</span> pack.
</div><div class="indent">~No matter which engine you're using, you can play the mod by running the .exe.
</div><div class="indent">~NOTE: This is how modders test their mods without packing them.
<div class="vspace"></div></div><div class="indent">As for modding
itself, what you should do is modifying certain files and make new
ones. Since there are many files you might need to modify or make, read
the explanation of what each text does below to know what to do with
them.
<div class="vspace"></div></div><div class="indent">Once you're done and satisfied with your mod, the last step is packing it.
</div><p class="vspace"><strong>Creating a PAK File:</strong>
</p><div class="indent">~You'll need a program called PACKER.exe.
</div><div class="indent">~Put this program in same folder with DATA folder which contains your mod.
</div><div class="indent">~Run this command: packer.exe [packfile]
DATA. [packfile] is the name of pak you want to create. Actually the
DATA can be replaced with other name if you 'DATA' folder has different
name but let's use that name.
</div><div class="indent">~If you do it right, a window showing DOS messages about packing files will appear.
</div><div class="indent">~The .pak should be in same folder.
</div><div class="vspace"></div><hr>
<div class="vspace"></div><h2>MODELS.txt:</h2>
<p><a name="Models" id="Models"></a>
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><div class="indent">This text file determines
what entities which are loaded and are going to be loaded to the
engine. This file is mandatory obviously. Aside from that, this file
also determines some general settings for models.
</div><div class="indent">Models.txt must be placed right under DATA folder.

</div><div class="indent">npc: The entity is a CPU controlled ally that
will seek out and attack enemies. The entity is otherwise functionally
identical to enemy entities with the chase subtype. You can change the
NPC allegiance via hostile setting. Npc types do not count toward
groups.
</div><div class="indent">item: The entity is a stationary item which
can be picked up. Items can only give one bonus per item. In other
words, you can't make one item that both gives 2000 points AND gives a
1-up.
</div><div class="indent">none: The entity is a useless decoration.
</div><div class="indent">steamer: The entity constantly spews the object called Steam upwards with alpha transparency.
</div><div class="indent">obstacle: The entity is a stationary blockade which can (normally) be destroyed.
</div><div class="indent">text: The entity is a message object. When
spawned, it will freeze all objects in play and show it's IDLE
animation, then dissapear. It can be sped up by pressing attack or
jump. Can be used for level intros, mid-level cutscenes, etc.
</div><div class="indent">trap: The entity is an obstacle which cannot
be attacked. It can be made to attack, though, and will hit both
players and enemies. If a trap is not set up to knock the entity down,
the trap will only damage the entity one time. To hit them again, the
target entity must take damage from another entity.
</div><div class="indent">endlevel: The entity is an item which, when
touched by a player, will end the stage. It can be given a score value
to be awarded for level completion.
</div><div class="indent">pshot: The type is outdated and does nothing. You can still use it, but it's ignored.

both). This type is used to make multiple layers.
</div></div><p class="vspace">subtype {type}

<div class="indent">arrow: The entity flies from right to left off the
screen. You can use the "flip" command when spawning it to make it fly
left-to-right.
</div><div class="indent">noskip: Used with text-type entities. It prohibits the player from using attack or jump to skip through text.
</div><div class="indent">weapon: Used for player weapons which can be picked up and used.
</div><div class="indent">biker: Used for Biker enemies. They fly left and right across the screen and must be knocked off their bikes to be stopped.
</div><div class="indent">notgrab: Does the same thing as the cantgrab command: the entity can't be grabbed.
</div><div class="indent">touch: For items. The item will be collected just by touching it. You won't need to press the attack button.
</div><div class="indent">flydie: For obstacles. When hit, the obstacle will fly horizontally offscreen while playing it's FALL animation.
</div><div class="indent">both: For endlevel items. If there are two players, both must be touching this item to end the stage.
</div><div class="indent">project: For items. When picked up, this
entity is treated like a weapon which doesn't actually change any of
the character's attributes except for their projectiles. Works for both
players and enemies (if they have a GET animation).
</div><div class="indent">chase: For enemies and projectiles. If given
to an enemy, he/she will walk towards player all the time. If player is
far from the enemy, he/she will run instead. If given to projectile, it
will become homing projectile.
</div><div class="indent">follow: For npcs. Will cause an npc to
attempt to follow the entity that spawned or summoned it (see below).
Uses range setting in idle animation to determine how close it will
follow. If the npc exceeds the minimum range and no entities it is
hostile towards are nearby, it will move to the spawning entity
normally. If it exceeds maximum range, the npc will instantly warp to
the spawning entity regardless of what it is currently doing and play
it&#8217;s respawn animation if it has one. An npc without this subtype will
behave exactly like an enemy with the chase subtype. It can potentially
follow a hostile across the entire level, and will wander randomly if
no hostiles are available.

declared more than once in animation. With the exception of 'frame',
they must be declared BEFORE respective 'frame' and can only be done
once.
</div><div class="indent">"Frame" commands are commands which can only
be declared once per animation however they have frame parameter to
define at which frame they work. Related commands are here too.
</div><div class="indent">Attack supplement are commands which should
be declared together with 'attack{#}' and typed between 'attack{#}' and
'frame'. They also work with 'blast', 'steal', 'burn', 'shock' and
'freeze'.

</div><p class="vspace">fastattack {bi}
</p><div class="indent">~Normally, in order for an attack to hit
entities multiple times, the attack boxes must be separated by at least
one frame with an empty attack box (one set to all 0) and must also be
separated by a brief delay.

attack boxes are not restricted by the delay (it will still need an
empty attack box between frames, though).

</p><div class="indent">~Allows characters to dive while in air. So obviously, they need to be in the air for it to work.
</div><div class="indent">~Actually this command simply makes entity
moves downwards so it works even on ground. However, it's buggy cause
entity will be stuck.
</div><div class="indent">~NOTE: Animations with this ALWAYS starts
diving at the first frame. If you want to change starting frame, you

</div><p class="vspace">attackone {bi}
</p><div class="indent">~This command sets attackboxes's ability in the animation to hit other opponent.
<div class="indent">0 = attackboxes can hit all opponents. This is default setting for all animations but grabattacks
</div><div class="indent">1 = attackboxes can only hit one opponent. This is default setting for all grabattacks.

</div><p class="vspace">bouncefactor {r}
</p><div class="indent">~This command determines bounce effect after
touching ground while falling to ground. It works even if entity is
falling while playing non-FALL animation.
</div><div class="indent">~{r} is bounce ratio which controls bounce
effect. If it's set to 1, entity will bounce forever. If it's set to 2,
it will bounce longer than normal. Any bigger value has slight
difference.

</p><div class="indent">~This command allows animation change by
inputting sequence of inputs to certain freespecial. In other word,
cancel. Obviously it's only for players.
</div><div class="indent">~This command can be declared in any attack
animations, jump animations and grab animations. Also it can be
declared more than once in same animation for various cancels.
</div><div class="indent">~{start frame} and {end frame} defines
frames where sequence of inputs is accepted. Inputs entered before
{start frame} and after {end frame} will be ignored.
</div><div class="indent">~{hits} defines how many hits attackboxes in
this animation must hit before cancelling is allowed. It doesn't matter
whether the attacks are blocked or not. If you don't want to have this
limit, just set it to 0.
</div><div class="indent">~{sequence of inputs} defines input sequence
required to activate the freespecial. The accepted values here is
exactly same with 'com' command in Entity Files: Header Date above.
</div><div class="indent">~{freespecial#} defines the freespecial to
be played after input sequence is valid. Don't forget to set
'maxfreespecials' (see models.txt above) if you need more freespecials
to access.
</div><div class="indent">~Technically, the animation cancelling is
like this: when valid sequence is accepted, this animation will stop
immediately and defined freespecial will be played.
</div><div class="indent">~If 'cancel' is declared in jump animation,
the freespecial will subject to gravity and will end immediately when
player landed like any jump animations.
</div><div class="indent">~If 'cancel' is declared in grab animation, grabbed enemy will be freed IOW player is not in grabbing state anymore.
</div><div class="indent">~If you declare 'cancel' in GRAB for player
who also has GRABWALK, declare it in latter animation too so the input
is received even if player is grabwalking. Same goes with GRABBACKWALK.
</div><div class="indent">~Be careful in using single button input
cause engine can easily accept the input when this animation is played.
For example, cancel with just attack button as input in GRABATTACK will
make cancel activated immediately as soon as it's played. To avoid
this, set {start frame} late enough for engine to remove the input
which activated GRABATTACK.
</div><p class="vspace">chargetime {int}
</p><div class="indent">~Determines how long player must hold attack button before releasing it to unleash CHARGEATTACK.

per frame (that is, you can't have two attack boxes or an attack and an
attack4 box in the same frame). You can 'fake' an extra box or two by
adding in extra frames with different boxes and changing the delay
accordingly, but this takes up more memory (for the extra frames) and
doesn't work perfectly, so try to do so sparingly.

</div><div class="indent">~{z} determines attackbox' width in z axis.
</div><div class="indent">~If you change or repeat an attack box's
declaration later in the animation, you can create combos in same
animation. However, a certain amount of time must pass before targets
can be hit again (This can be avoided with 'fastattack'). Also, you
must have at least one frame with a blank attack box (One set to
'attack 0') between the two frames or sets of frames which combo.

<p><a name="Other" id="Other"></a>
</p>
<p class="vspace">Outside the Box:
</p><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> adds a lot to an already powerful, simple engine. But you can take things even further with a little thought.
</div><div class="indent">~Just because they're called SHOCK, FREEZE
and BURN doesn't mean they need to be bolts, icicles and flares. They
could be other elements, or not even elements at all- ever noticed that
most fighting games have separate graphics for low, mid, and high-level
attacks? Or ever wanted a character to just sit still for a second or
two? Among other things...
</div><div class="indent">~Related to above, various attackboxes,
SHOCK and BURN can be used to make custom slams and custom throws.
There are many commands that also helps making them.
</div><div class="indent">~Text objects pause the game and can play an
animation. You can use it for cutscenes which don't end the level. -
Use them wisely as they have to be stored in RAM, while cutscenes are
streamed in real-time.
</div><div class="indent">~Enemies can drop other enemies. That means you can create enemies with second forms.
</div><div class="indent">~An entity's offset, bbox, attack box, platform box, etc. don't need to overlap. Or even be close to one another. 
</div><p class="vspace">Cutscenes:
</p><div class="indent">~There is a difference in the format for
animated .gif files and not-animated .gif files. In other words, if you
have a single-frame animated .gif, it would be read by <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> differently than an identical non-animated .gif.
</div><div class="indent">~These scenes must have animated .gifs:
<div class="indent">--&gt; data/scenes/logo.txt

</p><div class="indent">~When you hit an enemy, you get 5x the attack's damage in points.
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">THROWing</span> an enemy will earn you the attack's damage in points (you don't get any multipliers).
</div><div class="indent">~You get 5x the attack's power in the
player's .txt file, not the damage dealt. So an attack with 1000 power
would always give 5000 points.
</div><div class="indent">~You get a one-up every 50,000 points.
</div><p class="vspace">Time:
</p><div class="indent">~Try to keep in mind how long it might take a
player to beat a group of enemies or a boss. It feels kind of
dissapointing to last 99 seconds against a high-health boss or endless
stream of enemies, only to die from time over.
</div><div class="indent">~To create an item which recovers a player's
time, name it Time in it's .txt file and in MODELS.txt and give it a
'health' and 'score' value of 0.
</div><p class="vspace">Projectiles:
</p><div class="indent">~Knives fly straight forward. They can fly over pits unless they are on the ground.
</div><div class="indent">~Stars can only be thrown during jumps. Three fly out at downward angles.
</div><div class="indent">~Bombs fly in an arc. They can be thrown over pits.
</div><p class="vspace">Player Swapping:
</p><div class="indent">~'load'ing a player character in a level's .txt
file will cause the player's character to become the loaded character.
You can't bring the character select screen back up, though.
</div><div class="indent">~You can allow players to "unlock"
characters in-game by only "know"ing the player in MODELS.txt, but
putting an item which "load"s the entity in it's header. If a player
grabs the item, they will be able to select the new character whenever
they run out of lives or go to the select screen. This isn't saved when
you close the game, though.
</div><p class="vspace">Other notes:
</p><div class="indent">~Both <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>.exe and <span class="wikiword">WAV2BOR</span>.exe
only work with short file names. If you put them in directories with a
file or folder name longer than 8 characters, they won't work.
</div><p class="vspace">Fun:
</p><div class="indent">~Try to keep your mod interesting. The original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> engine had a lot of neat tricks and fun potential which was never realized, and <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> increases those possibilities exponentially. Think carefully about what you do with them.
</div><div class="indent">~The little things make a difference. The secret enemy in the original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>'s elevator, the wacky names, the entire hidden stage...
</div><div class="indent">~There are more fighting styles than just the

out. There are some interesting styles and attacks out there. Variety

</div><div class="indent">~It's possible to make 2D levels like ones

</div><p class="vspace">Limits :

</div></div><p class="vspace">*: Although the source code has been
changed to allow up to 52 panels per stage, a way of using panels past
26 has not yet been decided upon. There are only 26 letters in the
alphabet, after all. So you can only use 26.
</p>
<p class="vspace">**: NA means this particular caveat is no longer
limited by source code. In other words, if you want to create a mod
with 10,000 models, 5000 animations or an animation with 500,000
frames, that's your business. Keep in mind however that with great
power comes great responsibility; it is up to you to properly manage
hardware resources (in particular memory), especially if you intend for
your module to play on consoles.

<div class="vspace"></div><h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><a name="FAQ" id="FAQ"></a>
</p>
<p class="vspace question"> What do you mean by "entity?"</p>
<div class="indent">~It's anything you load in Models.txt. It's
basically a .txt file which tells the game how to display and use a
player, an enemy, a barrel, an apple, etc...
</div><p class="vspace question"> What's a "hud?"</p>
<div class="indent">~HUD: Heads-Up Display. It's what shows you life,
your score, your player, etc. It's a display which gives you a heads-up
as to what's going on.
</div><p class="vspace question"> Can I enter my initials on the high score screen?</p>
<div class="indent">~Nope, sorry.
</div><p class="vspace question"> What is this 'z' which oftenly mentioned in this manual?</p>
<div class="indent">~That 'z' refers to Z axis, another axis perpendicular to X axis. That's the convention to define 'back' or 'front'.
</div><p class="vspace question"> Why don't you use 'y' instead?</p>
<div class="indent">~That's because 'y' refers to altitude axis instead.
</div><p class="vspace question"> I can't find any info about scripting in <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> here! Where is it?</p>
<div class="indent">~I am really sorry about that. Scripts are more
complex than usual commands listed above and they require more
explanation. Also scripting basics are required for using scripts. </div><p class="vspace question"> Help! My settings are all wrong/My controls have randomly changed/My high scores were replaced by gibberish!</p>
<div class="indent">~The settings file format may have changed. Try deleting or moving your settings.sav file in the same directory as <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> and reopening <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>.
</div><p class="vspace question"> My settings won't save on the Dreamcast version!</p>
<div class="indent">~This is a known issue. It seems the Dreamcast VMU (which is the only way to save on the DC) doesn't get along very well with <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>, and getting them to work together would require too many major changes to be possible.
</div><p class="vspace question"> Where is the <span class="wikiword">DC/PS2</span>/PSP/Windows/X-Box/<span class="wikiword">Linux/GP32</span>/<span class="wikiword">GP2X</span>/NDS version of <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>?</p>
<div class="indent">~Windows, DOS, Dreamcast, PSP, <span class="wikiword">GP2X</span> and X-Box binaries/executables are available in in the recent releases by <span class="wikiword">SumolX</span>. The <span class="wikiword">PS2</span> and <span class="wikiword">GP32</span> ports of the original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> were all done by separate coders, none of whom have expressed interest in porting <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>.
Without skilled coders for those platforms, those ports will not be
possible. As of this time, I don't think the NDS version by <a class="wikilink" href="http://www.dreamcast-scene.com/index.php/Main/GPF?action=print">GPF</a> is done yet.
</div><p class="vspace question"> What is this <span class="wikiword">BoR/OpenBoR</span>/<span class="wikiword">DarkBoR/BoRHed</span>/<span class="wikiword">HoR/AotB</span> thing I keep hearing about?</p>
<div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">BoR</span> is the original Beats of Rage. It is a free game made by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.senile-team.com/" rel="nofollow">Senile Team</a>. It doesn't have most of the features found in <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>, but it is the original.
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> was an upgraded version of <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> which has been worked on by many coders. <span class="wikiword">DarkBoR</span> was an alternate version of <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>
which has several unique features such as an MP bar and enhanced
weapons support. It was developed by Tails, but it is now merged with <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> to make a single engine. 
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">BoRHed</span> is an edit of <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> with new features similar to <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>. It is developed by Lord_Ball and hopefully will be merged soon with <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>.
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">HoR</span> is an edit of <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> designed to create shooting games. It is developed by Lord_Ball.
</div><div class="indent">~<a class="wikilink" href="http://www.dreamcast-scene.com/index.php/Main/AgeOfTheBeast?action=print">Age of the Beast</a> (<span class="wikiword">AotB</span>) is a "sequel" of sorts to the original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>.
The storyline, characters and music are original work made from
scratch, but some basic gameplay elements will be similar to the
original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>. It's being developed by Senile Team, creators of the original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>.
</div><p class="vspace question"> Which version of <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> should I use?</p>
<div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> is by far the best choice as of this moment. Each version has its advantage though:
</div><div class="indent">~The original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> is the only version with certain ports (such as <span class="wikiword">PS2</span> or <span class="wikiword">GP32</span>) so it has the greatest compatability.
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> has many new features and backwards compatability to the original <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> or <span class="wikiword">DarkBoR</span>. It also is the most optimized version.
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">BoRHed</span> also adds new features, but an entirely different set.
</div><div class="indent">~<span class="wikiword">HoR</span> was designed for overhead/sideview shooters, so that's something of a different situation.
</div><div class="indent">~<a class="wikilink" href="http://www.dreamcast-scene.com/index.php/Main/AgeOfTheBeast?action=print">AotB</a> isn't out yet. So, um, it's not really a choice at the moment.
</div><p>You may be able to create multiple versions compatabile with the different versions of <span class="wikiword">BoR</span>, like how game companies release cross-platform games. That's extra work, though.
</p>
<p class="vspace question"> I'm amazed to see 10 different attackboxes. Why would someone need that many?</p>
<div class="indent">~You should be amazed on the effects you could make
with them. With many attackboxes, modders can make an attack that push
an opponent backwards, pull him/her, launchers and other cool effects.
</div><p class="vspace question"> When is <span class="wikiword">AotB</span> going to be released?</p>
<div class="indent">~When it's done. Coding games is actually a
difficult and annoying not-tons-of-fun task. Especially when you don't
get paid. And even more so if people ask for demo versions or release
dates. It's being worked on. It'll come when it's ready. Asking will at
best do nothing and more often just slow things down.
</div><p class="vspace question"> I found an error in this guide.</p>
<div class="indent">~Then please report it at <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lavalit.com/index.php?topic=45" rel="nofollow">LavaLit.com</a>.

<div class="indent">~If you do want to ask for new features, think
first. How many people besides you would use the feature? Would it be
possible to program? Would it make problems with older versions? Has
someone else asked for something similar? If you still want to ask, be
sure to do so nicely. The people in the <span class="wikiword">BoR</span> scene are nice, and they are not getting paid for this, so they deserve some little thanks, right?
</div><div class="indent">~Also try making them with scripts. If they are doable with scripts, your request for them will be rejected.
</div><p class="vspace question"> I want to HELP add something to <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span>.</p>
<div class="indent">~Awesome! Head to <span class="wikiword">LavaLit</span> forums and let <span class="wikiword">SamuraiX</span>
know. As a warning, even if your addition is really good, it may not be
added. Backwards compatability, speed, memory, and Dreamcast/PSP
compatability are all important factors in what gets added or not.
</div><p class="vspace question"> Can I make my own version of <span class="wikiword">BoR/OpenBoR</span>/<span class="wikiword">DarkBoR</span>?</p>
<div class="indent">~Of course. If you're only making small,
mod-specific changes (like changing the design of system menus), go
ahead. If you're making larger changes (like new features or options),
it would be nice if you mentioned it on the <span class="wikiword">OpenBoR</span> forums, but that's still not enforced or anything.
